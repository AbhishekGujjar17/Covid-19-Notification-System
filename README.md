# Covid-19-Notification-System
In this project, I created a Realtime Coronavirus Outbreak Notification System Using Python. 


1. Make sure you have Python (Version 3.7 or higher) installed in your system.
2. Open the folder in CMD and type pip install -r requirements.txt for installing all the required packages.
3. Now edit the main.py file using your favorite code editor(Example: Sublime text editor, VSCode, Vim).
4. Enter Your State Name in Line no 30. (Don't enter more than 5 States). (Example: states = ['Delhi', 'West Bengal', 'Maharashtra',])
5. Now save the file, close the editor and run main.py.
6. This Program Will Only Work On Windows 10 Currently.
